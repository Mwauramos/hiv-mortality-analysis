# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: HIV AND CHILD MORTALITY ANALYSIS

## Project Overview
Comprehensive analysis of global HIV burden and child mortality patterns in East African Community using WHO and UN data (2000-2023).

## Key Findings

### HIV Global Burden
- **Highly concentrated**: Just 14 countries (9.7% of reporting countries) account for 75% of global HIV burden
- **South Africa** leads with 22.6% of global cases (51.4M cases)
- **AFR region** dominates with 80.2% of global burden

### Child Mortality in East Africa
- **Significant disparities**: 102.4-fold difference between highest (Somalia: 142.9) and lowest (United Republic of Tanzania: 40.5) mortality rates
- **Regional progress**: Average 85.2% decline in under-5 mortality across EAC countries
- **Strong correlation** between neonatal and under-5 mortality (r=0.88, p<0.05)

## Policy Implications
1. **HIV Prevention**: Concentrate resources on 14 high-burden countries for maximum impact
2. **Child Health**: Urgent intervention needed in Somalia
3. **Regional Cooperation**: EAC should facilitate best practice sharing
4. **Data-Driven Allocation**: Use burden analysis to guide resource distribution

## Technical Approach
- **Statistical rigor**: Significance testing, correlation analysis, trend analysis
- **Data quality**: Handled complex formatted data, missing values, country name variations
- **Visualization**: Professional, publication-ready charts following best practices
- **Reproducible**: Complete code pipeline from raw data to insights

## Data Sources
- WHO Global Observatory (HIV surveillance, 144 countries)
- UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (8 EAC countries)
- Analysis period: 2000-2023 (24 years)
