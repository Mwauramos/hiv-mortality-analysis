# CHILD MORTALITY ANALYSIS - KEY INSIGHTS

## East African Community Performance
- **Highest under-5 mortality**: Somalia (142.9 per 1,000)
- **Lowest under-5 mortality**: United Republic of Tanzania (40.5 per 1,000)
- **Range**: 102.4 per 1,000 difference between best and worst
- **Regional average**: 66.4 per 1,000 live births

## Progress Analysis
- **Best progress**: Somalia (90.5% decline)
- **Regional trend**: **Significant decline** over time (p=0)
- **Average decline**: 85.2% across all countries

## Neonatal vs Under-5 Relationship
- **Correlation**: 0.883 (significant, p=0.0036)
- **Interpretation**: Countries with high neonatal mortality also have high under-5 mortality

## Policy Recommendations
1. **Urgent Intervention**: Somalia needs immediate child health system strengthening
2. **Best Practices**: Learn from United Republic of Tanzania's success in reducing mortality
3. **Regional Cooperation**: EAC should facilitate knowledge sharing between high and low mortality countries
4. **Targeted Programs**: Focus on neonatal care in countries with high neonatal-to-under5 ratios
