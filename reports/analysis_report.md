# HIV and Child Mortality Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines global HIV burden patterns and child mortality trends in East African Community countries using WHO and UN surveillance data from 2000-2023.

## Key Findings

### HIV Global Burden
- **14 countries** account for 75% of global HIV burden
- **South Africa** leads with 51.4 million cases over the analysis period
- High burden concentration suggests targeted prevention strategies could achieve significant impact

### Child Mortality in East Africa
- **Highest under-5 mortality**: Somalia (161.6 per 1,000 live births)
- **Lowest under-5 mortality**: Uganda (29 per 1,000 live births)
- Significant disparities persist across the region despite overall declining trends

## Policy Implications

### HIV Prevention
- Focus prevention resources on 14 high-burden countries for maximum population-level impact
- Prioritize interventions in sub-Saharan Africa where burden is concentrated
- Develop regional strategies that address common epidemiological patterns

### Child Health
- Somalia requires urgent child health system strengthening
- Examine successful strategies implemented in Uganda for potential replication
- Strengthen regional cooperation mechanisms within East African Community

## Data and Methods

### Data Sources
- **WHO Global Observatory**: HIV surveillance data (1084 observations, 144 countries)
- **UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation**: Child mortality data (2536 observations, 8 EAC countries)
- **Analysis period**: 2000-2023 (24 years)

### Analytical Approach
- Burden analysis using cumulative proportion calculations to identify high-impact countries
- Temporal trend analysis to examine changes over time
- Comparative analysis across countries and regions
- Professional data visualization following best practices

### Technical Implementation
- Custom parsing functions for complex formatted surveillance data
- Robust handling of missing data and country name variations
- Reproducible analysis pipeline using R and tidyverse
- Publication-quality visualizations with consistent design

## Conclusions

The analysis reveals significant concentration in both HIV burden globally and child mortality within East Africa. This concentration creates opportunities for targeted, high-impact interventions. The 14-country HIV focus strategy and urgent attention to Somalia's child health challenges represent evidence-based priorities for resource allocation.

Regional cooperation mechanisms should facilitate knowledge transfer from successful countries like Uganda to those facing greater challenges. Data-driven approaches can guide more effective resource allocation and intervention strategies.
